# Prediction on Animal Type

## Summary

The data set we will be using is Zoo (1990) provided by UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. It stores data with 7 classes of animals and their related characteristics including animal name, hair, feathers and other attributes. In this project, we will use classification as our method to predict a most likely type of a given animal.
