## Short Summary
The dataset we will be using is the Zoo (1990) provided by UCL Machine Learning Repositry. It stores data about 7 class animals and related factors inlcuding animal name, hair, feathers etc are contained. In this project, we will use classification to classify a given animal to the most likely type. We will be using multiple analysis to classify the type of the animals using 15 variables including hair, feathers, eggs, milk, airborne, aquatic, predator, toothed, backbone, breathes, venomous, fins, legs, domestic, and catsize as our predictors. To predict the class of a new observation, the algorithms of each type will be mentioned in the main project.
