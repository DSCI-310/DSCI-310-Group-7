## Abstract
The data set we used is the Zoo (1990) provided by UCL Machine Learning Repositry. It stores data about 7 classes of animals and their related factors inlcuding animal name, hair, feathers and so on. In this project, we picked classification as our method to classify a given animal to its most likely type. All of 16 factors including hair, feathers, eggs, milk, airborne, aquatic, predator, toothed, backbone, breathes, venomous, fins, legs, tail, domestic, and catsize were selected as our predictors. To best predict the class of a new observation, we implemented and evalutated models based on a list of algorithms including k-Nearest Neighbor(k-NN),Â Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression. After a comparison among accuracies of different models, we finally found that algorithm k-NN produced the most accurate result of predicting animal type. Please kindly review our [analysis](analysis/zoo_analysis.ipynb) for more details.

|python                    | 3.9.7    |
|pandas                    | 1.4.1    |
|scikit-learn              | 1.0.2    |   
|matplotlib                | 3.5.1    |   
|numpy                     | 1.22.2   |   
|pytest                    | 7.0.1    |   

   see [dockerfile](Dockerfile) and [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sasiburi/dsci-310-group-7)

2. Steps to run: 

   a. Run in your terminal

   ```
   docker pull sasiburi/dsci-310-group-7:latest
   ```

   *Note: You can replace `latest` by another specific version.  Please kindly read the **History of Releases** for more versions.*

   <br>

   b. Run the docker image

   Clone this repository by command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/DSCI-310/DSCI-310-Group-7.git
   ```

    *Note*: you can find detailed instructions of repository clone from [here](https://github.com/DSCI-310/DSCI-310-Group-7.git).

   Make sure you are at the local location of the cloned repository, then obtain the reproducible environment by following command:

   ```
   docker run --rm -it -p 8787:8888 -v /$(pwd):/opt/notebooks sasiburi/dsci-310-group-7:v2.0.0
   ```
   
   *Note: if port 8787 has been allocated, you can replace 8787 by other random four-digit number.*
   
   <br>
   
   c. Access the file via JupyterLab
   
   Open link [http://localhost:8787](http://localhost:8787/)
   
   *Note: If you choose other number as your port, please replace 8787 by the four-digit number you chose.*
   
   Required token can be obtained on your terminal. For example, `token=3912f59232fe3b260fda201da4e822e69bfed02e649dc56b`, then `3912f59232fe3b260fda201da4e822e69bfed02e649dc56b` is the token.
