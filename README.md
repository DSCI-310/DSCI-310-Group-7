## Abstract
The data set we used is the Zoo (1990) provided by UCL Machine Learning Repositry. It stores data about 7 classes of animals and their related factors inlcuding animal name, hair, feathers and so on. In this project, we picked classification as our method to classify a given animal to its most likely type. All of 16 factors including hair, feathers, eggs, milk, airborne, aquatic, predator, toothed, backbone, breathes, venomous, fins, legs, tail, domestic, and catsize were selected as our predictors. To best predict the class of a new observation, we implemented and evalutated models based on a list of algorithms including k-Nearest Neighbor(k-NN),Â Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression. After a comparison among accuracies of different models, we finally found that algorithm k-NN produced the most accurate result of predicting animal type. There are several ways to repeat/reproduce our analysis, please kindly find details in **Usage** section.

## Result
The final report can be viewed and rendered from either jupyter book or rmarkdown:

[Jbook Html](analysis/_build/html/index.html)

[Jbook Pdf](analysis/_build/latex/python.pdf)

[Rmd Htm](doc/zoo_analysis.html)

[Rmd PDF](doc/zoo_analysis.pdf)


## Usage
Our analysis report in form of jupyter book is stored at [analysis/_build/html/index.html](analysis/_build/html/index.html) and the report in other forms of [.Rmd](doc/zoo_analysis.Rmd). [.jpynb](analysis/original_report/zoo_analysis.ipynb) and [.pdf](doc/zoo_analysis.pdf) are also viewable.
In order to repeat/reproduce our jupyter book report, there are two suggested ways:

### Via Docker

**a. Run in your terminal**

```
docker pull sasiburi/dsci-310-group-7:latest
```

*Note: You can replace `latest` by another specific version.  Please kindly read the **History of Releases** for more versions.*

<br>

**b. Run the docker image**

Clone this repo by command:

```
git clone https://github.com/DSCI-310/DSCI-310-Group-7.git
```

*Note*: you can find detailed instructions of repository clone from [here](https://github.com/DSCI-310/DSCI-310-Group-7.git).

Make sure you are at the **root** of the cloned repo, then open it under the reproducible environment by following command:

```
docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 -v ${PWD}:/home/jovyan/work sasiburi/dsci-310-group-7:latest
```

*Note: if port 8888 has been allocated, you can replace 8888 by another random four-digit number.*

<br>

**c. Access files via JupyterLab**

Open link provided on the console

*Note: If a token is required, it can be obtained on your terminal. For example, `token=3912f59232fe3b260fda201da4e822e69bfed02e649dc56b`, then `3912f59232fe3b260fda201da4e822e69bfed02e649dc56b` is the token.*

<br>

**e. Re-build the report**

the report in forms of jupyter book can be re-built by command:

```
jupyter-book build analysis/
```
*Note: Make sure you are at the root of this repo.*



### Via MakeFile

**a. Still Clone this repo. Same command as above.**

**b. Installed all the **dependencies** listed as blow section.**

**c. `cd` to the root of the local repo, and then run command:**

```
make all
```
**d. Now you can access to the most up to date report.**

**e. reset the repo to clean, run the command:**

```
make clean
```
