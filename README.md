## Short Summary
The data set we used is the Zoo (1990) provided by UCL Machine Learning Repositry. It stores data about 7 classes of animals and their related factors inlcuding animal name, hair, feathers and so on. In this project, we picked classification as our method to classify a given animal to its most likely type. We also used multiple analysis to identify the type of the animals using 16 variables including hair, feathers, eggs, milk, airborne, aquatic, predator, toothed, backbone, breathes, venomous, fins, legs, tail, domestic, and catsize as our predictors. To best predict the class of a new observation, we implemented and compared a list of algorithms. Every type of algorithms will be mentioned in the main project [analysis](zoo_analysis.ipynb).
